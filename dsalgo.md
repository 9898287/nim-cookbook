Nim provides a variety of useful data structures such as arrays, sequences, sets, strings, tuples, tables. We will look at [strings](strings.html) in a later chapter.

# Tuples

## Unpacking a tuple into separate variables{#unpack}

### Problem

You have a tuple of `N`-elements that you want to unpack into `N` seperate variables.

### Solution


```{.input include=code/ds01.nim startLine=1 endLine=7}
```


Practical uses:

```{.input include=code/ds01.nim startLine=8 endLine=18}
```
