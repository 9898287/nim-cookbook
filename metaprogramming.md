> Metaprogramming is the writing of computer programs with the ability to treat programs as their data. It means that a program could be designed to read, generate, analyse and/or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running. -- [Wikipedia](https://hookrace.net/blog/introduction-to-metaprogramming-in-nim/)

Nim's two constructs -- templates, and macros offer powerful metaprogramming capabilities.
