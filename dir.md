## Directory Listing

### Problem: list of files in a directory

Print a list of files in a directory matching a pattern.

### Solution

Print the list of all `.nim` files in this directory

```{.input include=code/dir01.nim startLine=1 endLine=4}
```

You can even search in child directories.

```{.input include=code/dir01.nim startLine=6 endLine=7}
```
